# Discover GLOW !
GLOW stands for *Graphical Library for OpenGL Wizards* (because everyone who uses OpenGL is doing magic). It provides classes to simplify the use of *basic OpenGL features* (such as Texture, Shader, Windows, Inputs ...). It also allows developpers to easely create *User Interface* and handle events.
There are three different uses of GLOW, depending on your abstraction needs :
- Basic features wrapping (Shader, Texture ...)
- Global Managers (Texture loader, Input manager ...)
- Application logic and UI building

If you want to use OpenGL and try to not reinvent the wheel or if you're looking for a higher-level library in order to build you application or game, you should probably take a look at this project. ðŸ™‚

# About this project

GLOW was created after countless of little games and projects I made. I realized that I lost too much time coding the "core" of my games and not the mechanics of it. I decided to create an easy interface to create windows, menus, gui, buttons, manage inputs, render and update.
GLOW is a *work in progress*. Many changes will be done in the future. I'm trying not to hardly change what is already existing and keep interfaces clean.
Even if GLOW was first created for 2D-game designing it can be used for other applications that need OpenGL (custom graph rendering, 3D, user interfaces ...).
Lots of functionalities aren't optimized yet. I focused on simplicity more than optimality.
